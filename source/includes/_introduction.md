# Introduction

Unit21 uses machine learning to help businesses identify and investigate money laundering. We help our customers automate as much of the investigations workflows as possible, leading to more informed operational planning and strategic decision making.

<br>
The Unit21 workbench is a specialized investigations-focused system of record that takes in your data, intelligently processes it with a system of rules and machine learning algorithms, and enables the team to extract insights from their structured and unstructured data. Through the workbench, teams can search through every piece of information in the system efficiently, glean specific and noteworthy intelligence, and perform complicated analysis to reveal potential trends in the data that may be significant for any case.

<br>
Wherever relevant, we combine this detection logic with sanctions lists and blacklists to automatically file government reports (e.g. SARs) necessary to keep your organization compliant with anti-financial crime regulations. We recognize the immense value of a highly specialized and intuitive interface so that your team can spend more time in the actual investigation rather than in aggregating and making sense of the data. As such, we designed our data schema with simplicity and flexibility in mind.
