# Introduction

Unit21 uses machine learning & human intelligence to help businesses identify and investigate money laundering & fraud. We help our customers automate as much of the fraud/compliance review process as possible, minimizing time spent on manual case reviews.

<br>
The Unit21 workbench is a specialized ticketing system that takes in your data, intelligently processes it with a system of rules and machine learning algorithms, then surfaces noteworthy events to analysts and investigators for review. Through the workbench, teams can test, define and manage rules, craft workflows to drive risk detection logic, and perform manual review and investigations of flagged activity. 

<br>
Wherever relevant, we combine this detection logic with sanctions lists and blacklists to automatically file government reports (e.g. SARs) necessary to keep your organization compliant with anti-financial crime regulations. We recognize the immense value of a highly specialized and customizable interface so that time spent on manual case review is minimized. As such, we designed our data schema with simplicity and flexibility in mind.
