# Integration

We provide two modes of data integration: 1) streaming, 2) batch. Depending on your needs, either or both may be suitable.

1. **API integration** - Unit21 will provide an API key that gives you access to set of API endpoints to submit indvidual events or chunks of events. Customers select this option if there are near-real-time detection requirements.
2. **Batch upload** - We will provide a HTTPS or SFTP upload endpoint where periodic file uploads should be sent. These files should be in standard JSON or CSV format. All separate CSV files should have column names as the header row. Customers typically select this option if there are no real-time detection or resolution needs.

For enterprise use cases, we also have an easy-to-deploy hybrid on-off premise solution that ensures that any sensitive data is not shared, while still leveraging key trends that Unit21's system learns over time.

We will provide more details on either of these methods depending on your use-case. Should any other methods of integrations be more suitable or convenient, we are happy to provide resources to make it happen.
